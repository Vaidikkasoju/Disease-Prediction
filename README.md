**My Graduate Capstone Project** - This project explores the use of Machine Learning Algorithms to predict diseases from symptoms given by the user

**📁 Dataset:**
Used publicly available healthcare datasets containing symptoms and mapped diseases for supervised training.

**🔍 Key Features:**
Input-based prediction of diseases using symptom selection
Clean and intuitive UI for user interaction (if applicable)
Preprocessing of health-related datasets
Trained ML models using classification algorithms (Random Forest, Naive Bayes, etc.)
Evaluation through accuracy, precision, and confusion matrices

**🛠️ Tech Stack:**
Python for backend logic and ML modeling
Pandas, NumPy for data wrangling
Scikit-learn for training and testing ML models
